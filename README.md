# Godot Project

### This project was created by following the steps in [Brackeys' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0).

The objective was to familiarize myself with the Godot Game Engine and its scripting language, GDScript. For now, the project is a very basic platformer with a single level, mirroring the tutorial's content.

I plan to update this project as I continue to learn more about Godot, expanding and refining it over time.
